## Submitting Feedback

If you encounter errors, misleading or outdated information, report it so Expo can be improved:

Preferred command:
npx --yes submit-expo-feedback@latest --category docs --subject "/versions/latest/sdk/haptics/" "<actionable feedback>"

Direct HTTP fallback:
curl -X POST https://api.expo.dev/v2/feedback/docs-send -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"url":"/versions/latest/sdk/haptics/","feedback":"🤖 Agent feedback for docs: <specific, actionable description> (<model>, <harness>)"}'

Only submit when you have something specific and actionable to report. Try to give the most context.

Android, iOS, Web

`expo-haptics` provides haptic (touch) feedback for:

-   Android devices using Vibrator system service.
-   iOS 10+ devices using the Taptic Engine.
-   Web platforms using the Web Vibration API.

On iOS, the Taptic engine will do nothing if any of the following conditions are true on a user's device:

-   Low Power Mode is enabled. This can be detected with [`expo-battery`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/battery.md).
-   User disabled the Taptic Engine in settings.
-   iOS Camera is active (to prevent destabilization).
-   iOS dictation is active (to not disturb the microphone input).

On web, the library uses the Web Vibration API. Note the following:

-   The API must be supported by the browser (check [browser compatibility](https://caniuse.com/vibration))
-   The device must have vibration hardware
-   The user must grant permission to use vibration (usually automatic)
-   Some browsers may ignore vibration in certain contexts (for example, background tabs)

> For more advanced control over haptics, we recommend [Pulsar haptics SDK](https://docs.swmansion.com/pulsar/). It lets you create custom haptic patterns, use a wider set of presets, build gesture-based haptics, and run haptics on worklets.

## Installation

```sh
# npm
npx expo install expo-haptics

# yarn
yarn expo install expo-haptics

# pnpm
pnpm expo install expo-haptics

# bun
bun expo install expo-haptics
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/overview.md), make sure to [install `expo`](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules.md) in your project.

## Configuration

On Android, this library requires permission to control vibration on the device. The `VIBRATE` permission is added automatically.

## Usage

```jsx Haptics usage
import { StyleSheet, View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';
import * as Haptics from 'expo-haptics';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>

## API

```js
import * as Haptics from 'expo-haptics';
```

## Methods

### `Haptics.impactAsync(style)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `style`(optional) | [ImpactFeedbackStyle](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/haptics.md#impactfeedbackstyle) | A collision indicator that on Android is simulated using [`Vibrator`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Vibrator) and on iOS, it is directly mapped to [`UIImpactFeedbackStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimpactfeedbackgenerator/feedbackstyle). You can use one of `Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.{Light, Medium, Heavy, Rigid, Soft}`. Default: `ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium` |

  

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A `Promise` which fulfills once native size haptics functionality is triggered.

> **See:** Android's `Vibrator` API is not recommended for implementing haptics feedback. **Instead, you should use [`performAndroidHapticsAsync`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/haptics.md#hapticsperformandroidhapticsasynctype), which is similar to iOS haptic feedback and does not require `VIBRATE` permission.**

### `Haptics.notificationAsync(type)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type`(optional) | [NotificationFeedbackType](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/haptics.md#notificationfeedbacktype) | A notification feedback type that on Android is simulated using [`Vibrator`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Vibrator) and iOS is directly mapped to [`UINotificationFeedbackType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinotificationfeedbacktype). You can use one of `Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.{Success, Warning, Error}`. Default: `NotificationFeedbackType.Success` |

  

The kind of notification response used in the feedback.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A `Promise` which fulfills once native size haptics functionality is triggered.

### `Haptics.performAndroidHapticsAsync(type)`

Supported platforms: Android.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | [AndroidHaptics](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/haptics.md#androidhaptics) |

  

Use the device haptics engine to provide physical feedback to the user.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

### `Haptics.selectionAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Used to let a user know when a selection change has been registered.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A `Promise` which fulfills once native size haptics functionality is triggered.
