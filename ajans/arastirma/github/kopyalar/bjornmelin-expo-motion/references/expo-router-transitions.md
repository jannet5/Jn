# Expo Router & screen transitions

Navigation transitions in Expo are a platform contract, not a place for ad-hoc
product animation. Expo Router renders a **native stack** powered by
`react-native-screens`, so route push/pop, modal presentation, back gestures,
and header transitions are driven by UIKit/Android navigators. This reference
covers what navigation owns, how to configure it
through screen options, when to stay out of its way with Reanimated 4, how to
clean up route-scoped animations, and how `@expo/ui` native controls fit as
leaf nodes. For shared-value mechanics and threading, see
[Reanimated core](./reanimated-core.md); for content enter/exit, see
[Layout animations](./layout-animations.md).

## react-native-screens is the engine

Expo Router `Stack` is a thin layout over React Navigation's native stack, which
delegates route containers and gestures to `react-native-screens`. Treat route
movement as native-screens behavior unless the app explicitly opts into a custom
navigator.

- Confirm `react-native-screens` is installed at the Expo-compatible version
  before changing stack assumptions (use the target repo's `<repo-expo> install
  --check` wrapper).
- The native stack owns the **full screen shell**: push/pop, modal dismissal,
  edge-swipe back, hardware back. Do not replace those gestures with a
  full-screen Reanimated gesture just to customize back navigation.
- Reanimated may own content **after** the route is mounted and the transition
  has settled (row enter/exit, inline expansion). It should never animate the
  route shell itself.

## Configuring transitions with screen options

Set transition behavior through `Stack.Screen options`, centralized where route
ownership lives — in the `_layout.tsx`, not scattered across leaf content.

```tsx
// app/_layout.tsx
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <Stack screenOptions={{ headerShown: true }}>
      <Stack.Screen name="index" options={{ title: 'Home' }} />
      <Stack.Screen
        name="details"
        options={{ animation: 'slide_from_right', gestureEnabled: true }}
      />
      <Stack.Screen
        name="compose"
        options={{ presentation: 'modal', animation: 'slide_from_bottom' }}
      />
    </Stack>
  );
}
```

### `animation`

Controls native-stack screen movement. Current native-stack values include
`default`, `fade`, `fade_from_bottom`, `flip`, `simple_push`,
`slide_from_bottom`, `slide_from_right`, `slide_from_left`, `ios_from_right`,
`ios_from_left`, and `none`. Confirm the installed Expo Router/native-stack
types before using a platform-specific value.

- Use `animation: 'none'` to disable transitions. Treat the older
  `animationEnabled: false` as stale unless installed types prove otherwise.
- Some native transitions and presentations **do not allow custom durations**.
  Do not promise exact timing parity across platforms.

### `presentation`

Route semantics, not just a look: `card` (default push), `modal`,
`transparentModal`, `containedModal`, `fullScreenModal`, `formSheet`, plus
related platform presentations. iOS modal/sheet behavior does **not** all exist
on Android — validate both. Sheet detents are configured with native sheet
options and surfaced through events like `sheetDetentChange`.

### `gestureEnabled` and headers

- `gestureEnabled` toggles the interactive back gesture (iOS edge swipe). If a
  screen blocks back navigation, validate hardware back, edge swipe,
  accessibility escape/back, and deep-link restoration.
- Header options (`headerShown`, `title`, `headerTransparent`, large titles)
  drive native header transitions. `Stack.SearchBar` integrates with the native
  header and forces it visible; newer header primitives such as
  `Stack.Toolbar` are platform- and release-dependent, so check the installed
  Expo Router docs/types and provide an app-owned web fallback.
- `Stack.Header`, `Stack.Title`, and related primitives are composition helpers
  that write native-stack options; if multiple instances configure the same
  screen, the last rendered one wins.

## Shared-element / native transitions

Native shared-element and zoom transitions are exposed through
`react-native-screens` / native-stack options rather than a screen-level
Reanimated layout. Native-stack options are the production default. Reanimated
[Layout animations](./layout-animations.md) `sharedTransitionTag` is experimental,
feature-flagged, and not recommended for production; consider it only behind a
feature flag for content that is not a route-shell transition. Never layer it on
top of the native stack transition for the same screen.

## When navigation owns the lifecycle (don't fight it)

If movement is route-level, let the navigator drive it. Coordinate with — do not
replace — the transition using navigation listeners.

```tsx
import { useNavigation } from 'expo-router';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function Screen() {
  const navigation = useNavigation();
  useEffect(() => {
    const start = navigation.addListener('transitionStart', () => {});
    const end = navigation.addListener('transitionEnd', () => {
      // run content animation only after the route shell settles
    });
    return () => {
      start();
      end();
    };
  }, [navigation]);
  // ...
}
```

- Listen for `transitionStart`, `transitionEnd`, `gestureCancel`, and
  `sheetDetentChange` for route-lifecycle coordination.
- Keep expensive work out of transition frames; listeners coordinate state, they
  do not run heavy work synchronously.
- Do not use component-local Reanimated to simulate push/pop, modal, form-sheet,
  or native back-gesture behavior.

## Route-change cleanup

Route-scoped Reanimated work must be torn down on unmount, or animations and
gesture/scroll handlers leak across navigations.

```tsx
import { useFocusEffect } from 'expo-router';
import { cancelAnimation, useSharedValue } from 'react-native-reanimated';
import { useCallback } from 'react';

function Row() {
  const progress = useSharedValue(0);
  useFocusEffect(
    useCallback(() => {
      return () => {
        cancelAnimation(progress); // stop in-flight withTiming/withSpring
      };
    }, [progress]),
  );
  // ...
}
```

- Call `cancelAnimation()` on shared values driving in-flight animations.
- Kill scroll handlers and gesture detectors on unmount; do not leave a
  `useAnimatedScrollHandler` or `Gesture` attached to a torn-down screen.
- Watch params/unmount timing: a route can unmount mid-transition. Scope
  `beforeRemove`, transition listeners, and guarded navigation to the affected
  screen, and validate interrupted gestures (partial back-swipe cancel, rapid
  double back, route replacement).

## Expo UI controls as leaf nodes

`@expo/ui` renders real SwiftUI (iOS) and Jetpack Compose (Android) controls.
They are **native leaves**, not arbitrary RN animation surfaces.

```tsx
import { Host, Switch, Slider } from '@expo/ui';

function Settings() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Switch value={enabled} onValueChange={setEnabled} />
      <Slider value={level} onValueChange={setLevel} />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

- Every native subtree needs a `Host`. Use one obvious `Host` owner per native
  UI subtree; do not wrap a whole screen when only a leaf control needs it.
- Use universal `@expo/ui` for one tree across iOS/Android/web when the target
  Expo SDK lists the component as supported; drop to
  `@expo/ui/swift-ui` or `@expo/ui/jetpack-compose` (with their `/modifiers`)
  only when the universal API lacks a control.
- `matchContents` suits intrinsic controls — do **not** use it on the same axis
  as scrollable content; give scrollable hosts finite size.
- Use Reanimated for product content motion, not to clone a Switch/Slider/Picker
  the platform already provides. Use native `BottomSheet` (controlled by
  `isPresented`/`onDismiss`, semantic `snapPoints`) before a custom sheet.

## Pitfalls / Do-not

- Do not layer a screen-level Reanimated spatial transition on top of a native
  stack transition for the same screen — they fight.
- Do not reimplement push/pop, modal, or back gesture with Reanimated when a
  native-stack option exists.
- Do not assume iOS modal/sheet presentation behavior exists on Android.
- Do not promise custom durations on native transitions that disallow them.
- Do not scatter screen options across leaf content; centralize in the layout.
- Do not leave shared values, scroll handlers, or gestures running after a route
  unmounts — `cancelAnimation` and detach them.
- Do not treat `@expo/ui` controls as `Animated.View`; wrapping them in
  gesture/animation surfaces breaks native accessibility.
