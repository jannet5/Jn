Hand your AI coding agent a `DESIGN.md` and it stops guessing. Each file is a complete, reverse-engineered design system for a real app — **exact hex values, full type ramps, component states, motion curves, and haptics** — in plain markdown that Claude, Cursor, Codex, and Stitch read natively. No Figma exports. No JSON. No tooling. No setup.

> **Want an app that's not here?** [Request it in one click](https://github.com/Meliwat/awesome-ios-design-md/issues/new/choose) — or generate your own from a screen recording at **[www.spectr.to](https://www.spectr.to)**.

> Inspired by [awesome-design-md](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-design-md), reimagined for native mobile. All trademarks, logos, and visual identities remain the property of their respective owners — these documents exist so agents can generate UI that feels native to each platform.

## Quick start

1. **Browse the [live gallery](https://www.spectr.to/gallery)** — all 200 apps, every screen, rendered free in your browser.

2. **Open the app you want** — e.g. [spectr.to/gallery/spotify](https://www.spectr.to/gallery/spotify).

3. **Open its folder in this repo** — e.g. [`design-md/music/spotify/`](design-md/music/spotify/) — and grab the flavor you want. Drop it next to your `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`, then prompt your agent:

   > *"Build the Now Playing screen using `DESIGN-swiftui.md` for all styling — match the palette, type ramp, spacing, and motion exactly."*

Your agent now has the `#121212` canvas, the Spotify-green play button, the 4/8pt grid, the spring curves, and the haptics — not a vibe, the actual spec.

## What is DESIGN.md?

[DESIGN.md](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/docs/design-md/overview/) is a plain-text design system document that AI agents read to generate consistent UI. Just a markdown file. No Figma exports, no JSON schemas, no special tooling. Drop it into your project root and any AI coding agent (Claude, Cursor, Codex, Stitch) instantly understands how your screens should look.

| File | Who reads it | What it defines |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Coding agents | How to build the project |
| `DESIGN.md` | Design agents | How the app should look and feel |

**The full DESIGN.md packs — colors, SF Pro type ramps, component specs, SF Symbol usage, Dynamic Type behavior, HIG-correct layouts, haptics and motion — are free in this repo.** Every app folder holds all four flavors. The [Spectr gallery](https://www.spectr.to/gallery) renders a live screen preview of each.

## Four flavors per app

Each app ships four docs so you can pick the one that matches your stack:

| File | For |
|------|-----|
| `DESIGN.md` | Framework-neutral — any agent, any framework (Flutter, SwiftUI, UIKit, React Native, Kotlin Compose) |
| `DESIGN-swiftui.md` | SwiftUI-specific — `Color` / `Font` extensions, `ViewModifier`s, sample views, SF Symbols, `.sensoryFeedback` haptics |
| `DESIGN-expo.md` | Expo / React Native — design token module, StyleSheet, Reanimated + `expo-haptics`, `expo-router`, `@expo/vector-icons` |
| `DESIGN-android.md` | Jetpack Compose — `Color` token object, Material 3 `Typography`, `@Composable`s, `NavigationBar`, AndroidX Palette, `LocalHapticFeedback` |

## What's Inside Each DESIGN.md

Every file follows the [Stitch DESIGN.md format](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/docs/design-md/format/), adapted for iOS:

| # | Section | What it captures (iOS flavor) |
|---|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | Visual Theme & Atmosphere | Mood, density, platform personality |
| 2 | Color Palette & Roles | Semantic name + hex + system color mapping (light + dark) |
| 3 | Typography Rules | SF Pro / custom faces, full Dynamic Type hierarchy |
| 4 | Component Stylings | Buttons, cards, inputs, tab bars, nav bars, sheets — with states |
| 5 | Layout Principles | 4/8pt grid, safe areas, insets, whitespace philosophy |
| 6 | Depth & Elevation | Shadows, materials (`.regularMaterial`, `.thin`), blurs, surface hierarchy |
| 7 | Do's and Don'ts | Design guardrails aligned with Apple's HIG |
| 8 | Responsive Behavior | Device sizes, Dynamic Type, landscape, iPad adaptation, touch targets |
| 9 | Agent Prompt Guide | Quick color reference + ready-to-use SwiftUI / Expo / Compose prompts |

Each app folder includes:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `DESIGN.md` | Framework-neutral design system (what agents read) |
| `DESIGN-swiftui.md` | SwiftUI implementation code |
| `DESIGN-expo.md` | Expo / React Native implementation code |
| `DESIGN-android.md` | Jetpack Compose (Material 3, Kotlin) implementation code |
| `README.md` | Pack overview, signature moves, brand sources, and links to all four flavors |

## Collection

**200 packs across 11 categories**, organized exactly like the [live gallery](https://www.spectr.to/gallery). Every entry links to its folder; tap any phone in the gallery to see the tokens rendered.
